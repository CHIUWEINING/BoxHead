# BoxHead Game
## This is the Final project of the course `Software Studio` in 2022
## Description
### This is top-down shooter game called BoxHead. Actually, Boxhead is classical game we used to play. However, nowadays, there is no active way to play the same game. Accordingly, we recreate this classical game and make it more fascinating. We add a new mode called `dark mode` to limit the vision of the player. Additionally, we implement lots of new weapons include `laser gun`, `grenade`, `landmine`...etc. So click the link below and enjoy the game.
